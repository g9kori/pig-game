# PIG-Game ðŸŽ²
The Pig game is a popular dice game often played as a simple and fun party or family game

## Here's a brief overview of how it typically works:

1. Objective: The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach a predetermined number of points, usually 100.

2. Equipment: All you need to play is a standard six-sided die and a way to keep score.

3. Gameplay:
   - Players take turns rolling the die.
   - On your turn, you can choose to roll the die as many times as you want, accumulating points with each roll.
   - If you roll a 1, you lose all the points you've accumulated during your turn, and your turn ends. This is referred to as "pigging out."
   - If you roll any other number (2-6), you can choose to roll again or "hold" to keep your accumulated points.
   - The catch is that if you decide to keep rolling and you roll a 1 at any point, you lose all points for that turn.

4. Scoring:
   - Points are accumulated throughout a player's turn, with each non-1 roll adding to their total.
   - When a player decides to hold, their turn's total is added to their overall score.

5. Winning: The first player to reach the predetermined point target, usually 100, wins the game.

The Pig game is known for its risk-reward dynamics. Players must decide whether to press their luck and keep rolling to accumulate more points or play it safe by holding to secure their current points. Rolling a 1 can be a major setback, so there's an element of chance and strategy involved in the game. It's a simple yet entertaining game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.
